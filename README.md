# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection
The project consist on using Machine learning methods to create an application for the detection of diabetic retinopathy using image processing and artificial intelligence methods


Machine Learning (ML) is the branch of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed
	For this project, I decided to study the application of machine learning in the medical field. I have identified a problem where I think machine learning techniques can provide effective solutions. 
	Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. One of the most common complications of diabetes is diabetic retinopathy, It is the most common cause of permanent vision loss in the world, Early detection of this disease is very important.
My project has three parts:
	First I collected a set of data relevant to our problem, then I used pre-treatment techniques to clean and prepare the data for training our machine learning model. 
	I then chose an algorithm adapted to the problem and trained the model on the preprocessed data. I measured the model performance using appropriate metrics and adjusted and optimized the algorithm parameters. 
	Finally, I tested my model on a set of validation data to evaluate its performance in real conditions.
